# EECS-466-Project

Project for my EECS 466 - Computer Graphics Class

Attempting to implement the powercrust algorithm. Starting with an implementation for 2D surfaces to better
understand the algorithm and its steps. Will attempt to get a 3D version working after that.

Also will contain some code for generating point clouds from meshes to experiment with existing PCL library surface
reconstruction algorithms such as marching cubes.

## VoronoiDiagram

This is a program/library for computing the VoronoiDiagram from a set of points. Currently the project compiles
to a small demo that generates some random points and allows one to step through and view a graphic representation
of the current computation step.

To restart the computation using the 'r' key. To advance to the next computation step use the 'n' key.
